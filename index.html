        <h1>Vision</h1>
        <p> Our vision coming into this project is to build a NFT different than anything else that’s out there. We aren’t looking to mint out a bunch of beautiful, but useless pieces of art. We aim to provide a real non-fungible token that provides what all NFT’s should: real life utility and a good return on your investment. By combining the world of crypto with the world of dentistry we believe we can provide a service that simply does not exist yet. By owning a Smile Club NFT you will be eligible to stake for $miles, our unique token. In the short term $miles can be utilized for teeth cleanings and general dental check-ups provided by one of our founders, Colin Robertson, who will be a general dentist out of Shawnee, Oklahoma (Currently finishing up his sixth semester of dental school, two more to go). In the long term, as the community and liquidation pool begin to build, we plan to add more dental offices across the US, Canada, EU, Australia and wherever else our holders desire that will accept $miles as the primary form of payment for any dental care you may need. Non-holders within our community will still have the option to purchase $miles through a liquidation pool using Ethereum or USDC, therefore stabilizing the pool and allowing use of these cryptocurrencies in exchange for any dental treatment desired at one of our partnered dental practices. </p>

      <div id="Roadmap" data-tab-content>
        <h1>Roadmap</h1>
        <p>•Phase 1/5<p>
             <p>  -  To begin we must build a community around our vision. Transparency between the founders and the community will always be a top priority, so our entire team will be doxed from the start. We will announce our release date when we have built a community that supports our vision, the timing is dependent on you all! <p> 
        <p>•Phase 2/5<p>
              <p>  -	After a successful mint we will roll out our staking platform where holders can stake their NFTs for $miles<p>
        <p>•Phase	3/5<p>
             <p>  -  As holders began accumulating $miles and the liquidation pool starts to build, holders will be able to use their $miles for teeth cleanings and dental check-ups.<p>
        <p>•Phase	4/5<p>
              <p>  -	 As the liquidation pool balances it will open to non-holders and allow them to exchange Eth or USDC for $miles to be utilized at The Smile Club NFTs partnered dental practices. At this phase $miles can be used by holders and non-holders to purchase any dental treatment at one of our partnered dental practices.<p>
        <p>•Phase	5/5<p>
              <p>  -	 We will continue to expand The Smile Club NFTs partnered dental practices to allow easy access to care for all Smile Club NFT community members, both holders and non-holders.
